# MBTiles Interactivity Example

This iPhone project shows a basic usage of the route-me mapping library, 
along with its built-in support for offline-capable MBTiles map tiles, 
together with some custom additions that allow contextual data to be 
embedded along with the tiles on a per-pixel basis in a space-efficient 
way. When you touch a country, you get its name and an image of its 
flag, for the entire world, at six zoom levels, for every pixel on the 
globe, in a 29MB data file.
